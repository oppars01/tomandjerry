# Tom and Jerry
Counter Strike Global Offensive - Tom and Jerry game for jailbreak maps.

```
Authorized officials can start the game via Commander, ROOT or CFG. The object of the game is to escape from Tom before he kills you. Even if you say we don't have R, you can attack Tom. You can win the game as Jerry who kills Tom first or stays last. The game's starting health, speed and weapon can be adjusted separately for Tom and Jerry from the CFG file. Surprise cheese or milk may appear at certain intervals in the game. There is a possibility that a weapon will come out that will help you, as well as life.
